          <p>
            My Name is Pradeep Sahu. I'm 18 and this is my Blog page. Here I
            will Share about My Experiences and Stories of Life. I have tried
            and will try Lots of things which can be useful for most of the
            people. <br />
            Their is a saying that we learn from our mistakes but we also learn
            from other's mistakes as well we just need to know what they did
            wrong. so, we will not repeat it ourselves.
          </p>

          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p>
            I am Computer Science student. Currently, not in any college but i
            hope i will join next year. I took gap year because <br />1. To
            Truly know my interest and develop it into passion. <br />2.
            Discover my weekness and strong Points. <br />3. To join the best
            college in the world where i can learn new things, meet people from
            diverse culture and have the best knowledge about science and
            techology.

          <h1>Experience</h1>
          <p>
            Taking a gap year was not my intension but my intension is to attend
            the best university. <br />
            I didn't waste this time. I applied to many Scholarships one of them
            is KGSP/GKS (Korean Government Schloarship Program). I got to know
            about it this year in late march through youtube. I really love east
            asian culture and i am a big fan of gaming thats why i applied. Do i
            Get in? I dont know yet.. but i think they will reject me because of
            my disease i had TB last year although i can 100% fit now but why do
            they allow a diseased person like me. Except it i dont think
            anything can stops them from accepting me.. Lets hope i will be
            accepted.
